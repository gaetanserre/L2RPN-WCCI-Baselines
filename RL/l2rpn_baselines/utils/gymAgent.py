class GymAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    This class maps a neural network (trained using ray / rllib or stable baselines for example
    
    It can then be used as a "regular" grid2op agent, in a runner, grid2viz, grid2game etc.

    It is also compatible with the "l2rpn baselines" interface.

    Use it only with a trained agent. It does not provide the "save" method and
    is not suitable for training.
    
    .. note::
        To load a previously saved agent the function `GymAgent.load` will be called
        and you must provide the `nn_path` keyword argument.
        
        To build a new agent, the function `GymAgent.build` is called and
        you must provide the `nn_kwargs` keyword argument.
    
    Examples
    ---------
    Some examples of such agents are provided in the classes:
    
    - :class:`l2rpn_baselines.PPO_SB3.PPO_SB3` that implements such an agent with the "stable baselines3" RL framework
    - :class:`l2rpn_baselines.PPO_RLLIB.PPO_RLLIB` that implements such an agent with the "ray / rllib" RL framework
    
    Both can benefit from the feature of this class, most notably the possibility to include "heuristics" (such as: 
    "if a powerline can be reconnected, do it" or "do not act if the grid is not in danger")
    
    Notes
    -----
    The main goal of this class is to be able to use "heuristics" (both for training and at inference time) quite simply
    and with out of the box support of external libraries.
    
    All top performers in all l2rpn competitions (as of writing) used some kind of heuristics in their agent (such as: 
    "if a powerline can be reconnected, do it" or "do not act if the grid is not in danger"). This is why we made some 
    effort to develop a generic class that allows to train agents directly using these "heuristics".
    
    This features is split in two parts:
    
    - At training time, the "*heuristics*" are part of the environment. The agent will see only observations that are relevant
      to it (and not the stat handled by the heuristic.)
    - At inference time, the "*heuristics*" of the environment used to train the agent are included in the "agent.act" function.
      If a heuristic has been used at training time, the agent will first "ask" the environment is a heuristic should be
      performed on the grid (in this case it will do it) otherwise it will ask the underlying neural network what to do.
    
    Some examples are provided in the "examples" code (under the "examples/ppo_stable_baselines") repository that 
    demonstrates the use of :class:`l2rpn_baselines.utils.GymEnvWithRecoWithDN` .
